# Instalily.ai Website Clone

This is a clone of the [Instalily.ai](https://www.instalily.ai) website, created as a demonstration project.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Clean, modern UI that follows the original site's aesthetic
- Interactive elements including mobile menu and animations
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom styles)
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for utility-based styling

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
